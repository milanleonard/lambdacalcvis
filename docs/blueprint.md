# **App Name**: LambdaVis

## Core Features:

- Expression Input: Text input field for typing Lambda Calculus expressions.
- AST Visualization: Dynamically render and visualize the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the input expression.
- Reduction Steps: Single-step reduction functionality to evaluate the Lambda expression step-by-step.
- Step Display: Display the reduced expression after each step.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a monokai-like theme with a dark background
- Use #008080 (teal) as an accent color.
- The expression input and AST visualization should be side by side
- Use clear visual hierarchy for the AST visualization with distinct node styling.
- Ensure that expressions, steps, and other informational fields are easy to read.
- Provide subtle animations for each reduction step in the abstract syntax tree.
